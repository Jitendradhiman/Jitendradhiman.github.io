<p>Speech processing and machine learning. In my Ph.D., I am developing a novel two-dimensional (2-D) framework for speech analysis. 
In contrast to one-dimesional (1-D) short-time processing of speech signals, the proposed 2-D analysis of speech signal is applied jointly along time and frequency dimension of a time-frequency speech distribution such as a spectrogram.
The smaller spectro-temporal spectrogram patches are modeled using 2-D amplitude- and frequency modulated cosine carrier signals. The amplitude (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) are seperated using a 2-D demodulation technique which employ a new tool: <i>the complex Riesz transform</i>.
This highly accurate spectrogram demodulation technique gives AM and FM components which correspond to vocal-tract filter magnitude response and the 2-D spound source excitation signal, respectively.
The proposed framework gives several new insights into the speech signal characteristics jointly in the time-frequency plane.
The proposed technique is applied for several fundamental speech processing tasks such as pitch estimation, periodic/aperiodic speech separation, voiced/unvoiced speech separation, the time-frequency noise modeling for voiced and unvoiced sounds and the estimation of vocal-tract filter magnitude response.
Thus, this new class of algorithms can be highly promissing for speech analysis and synthesis.
